# Configura√ß√£o de Cluster Percona XtraDB-Backup

With Percona XtraDB Cluster you can write to any node, and the Cluster guarantees consistency of writes. That is, the write is either committed on all the nodes or not committed at all. For the simplicity, this diagram shows the use of the two-node example, but the same logic is applied with the N nodes.

# Xtrabackup

### Using Percona Xtrabackup

This is the default SST method (version 2 of it: xtrabackup-v2). This is the least blocking method as it uses backup locks. XtraBackup is run locally on the donor node, so it‚Äôs important that the correct user credentials are set up on the donor node. In order for PXC to perform the SST using the XtraBackup, credentials for connecting to the donor node need to be set up in the variable wsrep_sst_auth. Beside the credentials, one more important thing is that the datadir needs to be specified in the server configuration file my.cnf, otherwise the transfer process will fail.

# State Snapshot Transfer

State Snapshot Transfer is a full data copy from one node (donor) to the joining node (joiner). It‚Äôs used when a new node joins the cluster. In order to be synchronized with the cluster, new node has to transfer data from the node that is already part of the cluster. There are three methods of SST available in Percona XtraDB Cluster: mysqldump, rsync and xtrabackup. The downside of mysqldump and rsync is that the donor node becomes READ-ONLY while data is being copied from one node to another. Xtrabackup SST, on the other hand, uses backup locks, which means galera provider is not paused at all as with FTWRL (Flush Tables with Read Lock) earlier. State snapshot transfer method can be configured with the wsrep_sst_method variable.

# Bootstrapping the cluster

Bootstrapping refers to getting the initial cluster up and running. By bootstrapping you are defining which node is has the correct information, that all the other nodes should synchronize to (via SST). In the event of a cluster-wide crash, bootstrapping functions the same way: by picking the initial node, you are essentially deciding which cluster node contains the database you want to go forward with.

Bootstrapping the cluster is a bit of a manual process. On the initial node, variable wsrep_cluster_address should be set to the value: gcomm://. The gcomm:// tells the node it can bootstrap without any cluster to connect to. Setting that and starting up the first node should result in a cluster with a wsrep_cluster_conf_id of 1. After this single-node cluster is started, variable wsrep_cluster_address should be updated to the list of all nodes in the cluster.
